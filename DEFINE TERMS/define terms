GIT- distributed source code management software; doesn't require a netowrk to function
GITHub- a web-based repository hosting service that allows collaboration for projects
Repository-project being worked on
Clone- to download a copy of source/main code
Commit-to save code in project management system- creates unique 'bookmark' that keeps a record of changes
Push-sending commits to repository
Pull- download latest/ most up-to-date branch
Branch- a copy of the repository
Merge- combine 2 or more branches
Merge Conflict- when an older branch tries to merge with a more updated branch and it causes...issues
Fetch-obtain latest changes from online repository without merging; used to compare code instead of actually editing latest
Remote-version of something hosted on a server - can be connected to local clones so changes can be synced


A GIThub entry starts at the repository or source code. That code is then forked so a user can locally edit it freely and once the changes
are made, the user can make a pull request to either download an updated version, or the master branch, or to push their own branch.
With multiple users working on the repository, multiple branches would be merged in order to create the best version of the repository.
If an older branch tries to merge onto the master branch, this creates a merge conflict and code on either side must be edited to resolve it.
This process acts as a sort of loop until the project is complete
